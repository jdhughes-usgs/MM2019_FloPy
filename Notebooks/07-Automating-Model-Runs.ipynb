    "### Automating Model Runs - Streamflow Capture Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "All groundwater pumped is balanced by removal of water somewhere, initially from storage in the aquifer and later from capture in the form of increase in recharge and decrease in discharge (Leake and others, 2010). Capture that results in a loss of water in streams, rivers, and wetlands now is a concern in many parts of the United States. Hydrologists commonly use analytical and numerical approaches to study temporal variations in sources of water to wells for select points of interest. Much can be learned about coupled surface/groundwater systems, however, by looking at the spatial distribution of theoretical capture for select times of interest. Development of maps of capture requires (1) a reasonably well-constructed transient or steady state model of an aquifer with head-dependent flow boundaries representing surface water features or evapotranspiration and (2) an automated procedure to run the model repeatedly and extract results, each time with a well in a different location. In this exercise, we will perform a streamflow capture analysis of the Freyberg model domain by developing a MODFLOW model, running it as many times as there are active model cells, and then creating a streamflow capture fraction map to summarize the results.\n",
